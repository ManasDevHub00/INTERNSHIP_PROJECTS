# 💳 Loan Prediction System

A Machine Learning-based web application that predicts whether a loan application is likely to be approved based on an applicant's financial and personal information.

The application is developed using **Flask** for the web interface and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for prediction.

# 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters loan applicant details through the web form.
2. Flask receives the submitted data.
3. Categorical values are converted using saved Label Encoders.
4. Numerical values are standardized using the trained Scaler.
5. The processed data is passed to the trained KNN model.
6. The model predicts whether the loan is approved.
7. The prediction is displayed on the result page.

# 🏗️ Project Architecture

The Loan Prediction System follows a Machine Learning pipeline where user inputs are collected through a Flask web application, preprocessed using Label Encoding and Standard Scaling, and then passed to a trained **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model to predict loan approval.
